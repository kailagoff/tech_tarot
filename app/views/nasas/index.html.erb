<p>A single card reading can be an easy way to start the day. It can also be a learning tool, to start learning the deck. Whatver the cards have to reveal to you, just spend a moment on the imagery and meaning. Below is a tarot card, along with NASA's picture of the day. By considering the juxtapostion of these two cards together we can contemplate our place in it all.</p>
