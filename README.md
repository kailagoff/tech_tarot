## Description
_Tech Tarot is my capstone project for Epicodus. It was built with Ruby on Rails. I used  Materialize Bootstrap and Sass to help style the website. The Ruby gem Devise was used for authentication on the site, and Paperclip was used for image upload. ActiveRecord was utilized in order to store information to a pSQL relational database._

_The website is divided into several different sections. There is a home page that displays all the cards in the deck. There is A major and minor arcana section that shows the cards that are within that arcana._

### Site will potentially also include:

  * - [ ] Page that explains how to read and interpret the cards
  * - [ ] Page that gives a random card reading
  * - [ ] Animations
  * - [ ] Hand drawn versions of all the cards
